## About This Tutorial  
  
This tutorial will take you from configuring your own [Docker](https://www.docker.com) server and database to a building a fully interactive web application with tons of fun functionality. All tutorial files can be found in the [docs/tutorial](/docs/tutorial/) directory at the root of this repository and will be numerically ordered for your convenience. Follow along or pick and choose where to jump in. This project is about sharing what I’ve learned through nearly a year of trial and error and hopefully helping someone make less mistakes than I did. It’s about taking a project from zero to development and maybe even through to production.  
  
When I first started out, I had no idea where to start and I struggled to find a single resource that could take me through the whole process of web development. That’s what I hope this repository will eventually become. I will be providing some of the better references I was able to find as footnotes where helpful and I will also do my best to explain why I did things a certain way or at the very least warn you of how not to do it. I am a student and by no means an authority on any of the concepts or languages used in this project. I am simply documenting my journey should it be useful to anyone else at a similar stage in their programming career.  
  
## What is Shape-Share?  
  
**Shape-Share** is a concept I created with the sole purpose of exploring all facets of web development in the broadest sense. I wanted something I could expand upon without being limited by the what of it all. It’s less about shapes as it is about universality. It was also important to me that the project could be filled with content that I could easily render on my own without much fuss. What’s easier than pulling up the [Paint](https://jspaint.app/#local:7aebb2e52e46f8) app and drawing up a purple triangle? Plus, there’s no risk of copyright infringement or need to upload personal content.  
  
The first iteration of this project can be found in my other repository [Shape_Search](https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/shape_search). With that project I designed a members-only platform where users could make a free account and upload images of shapes and interact with other users. This time around, I am going to focus on delineating between content creators and the casual subscriber. Creators will have access to a dashboard where they can upload images and interact with fans while the casual user will simply collect and react to their favorite images.  
  
From there I’ll likely implement subscriptions to creators, the ability to comment, and anything else that sounds interesting or challenging. A key focus throughout this project will be to implement a safe and secure web application, not just a hacker’s fun box with gaping security holes. I became obsessed with web security throughout [Shape_Search](https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/shape_search) and most of my time was spent running in circles with how much there is to consider when hardening a website. It’s no joke. I plan to have the application pentested routinely to help identify trouble areas and maintain a **DevSecOps** mindset. So get to know an ethical hacker and let them practice on your project as well!  
  
> 🍎 Definition    
> **DevSecOps** : Short for **D**evelopmemt, **S**ecurity, **O**perations. It is a method or mindset in development that involves security throughout the life of the project. (This will be very important throughout the project.)  
  
Let’s get started!  
  
## Formatting Conventions in This Tutorial  
  
Before we get going, here are some typographical and formatting conventions I will be using throughout the tutorial. There will be a link to this section on every page of the tutorial so don’t worry about memorizing it.  
  
| Type of Text  | Corresponding Information                         |  
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |  
| **bold**      | Concept or term that will be defined soon               |  
| *italic*      | Project filename or path to file |  
| `inline code` | Code Snippet or variable identifier                                      |  
| [Links](Links.md#)     | Navigation both inside the tutorial and external sites                                                  |

## Some Considerations  
  
I am coding on a Macbook Pro and thus some of this tutorial will be Mac-specific. I will try to include resources for other operating systems where necessary but once you get your [Docker](https://docker.com) container up and running, we will essentially be building in a Linux environment anyways. More on this later.  
  
> 🔮 Crystal Ball    
> Most of this project will be containerized and not require you to store or install anything on your host computer itself but some secrets and security keys which will need to be handled outside of the project directory for obvious reasons.
