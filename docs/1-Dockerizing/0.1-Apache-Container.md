## ⛰ Overview  
  
In this lesson, we will make our first pass at a hardened Apache Docker container. This starts with a custom Dockerfile and concludes with a Docker Compose file for the service. This requires editing a few configuration files from the container itself; so we will pull/run the standard `httpd` image, copy out the needed `.conf` files, and then edit them locally. Instead of reaching our site at the default `localhost` in browser, we want a virtual host that can be reached at `shapecreations.com`. We will also be implementing SSL/HTTPS which requires a few extra steps , which is fairly involved because there are so many gotchas.  
  
## 🌲 Directory Tree  
  
Before we get too much further, let’s look at the directory tree for this lesson. I have included only what we will accomplish by the conclusion of this lesson. The VS Code configuration from [0.0-Module-Overview > VS Code Workspaces](./0.0-Module-Overview.md#vs-code-workspaces) should still be in the root of your ShapeCreations directory.
